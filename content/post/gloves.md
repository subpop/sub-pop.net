People often ask why I wear gloves at the keyboard. It's not because I'm too cheap to turn up the heat. A long time ago, I used to work in a giant, climate-controlled office building that permanently maintained a temperature of 72Â°. Because these buildings basically had permanent air-conditioning blowing into the office space, I found that my hands, and specifically my fingers, would get stiff and achy. The stiffer my fingers and hands became, the more difficult I found it to type. Since typing is an integral part of my profession, I began seeking a way to mitigate these climate-controlled conditions. I observed that my fingers only became cold as the day progressed; they were not cold in the morning. I decided to try wearing fingerless gloves during much of the work day to keep my fingers warm, and the difference has been noticeable enough that I have made a habit of it.
