When writing a job description, don't make these common mistakes or fall prey
to bad trends.

## Don't Sell Your Company ##

> We're a data-driven marketing channel big-data warehousing engagement
> analytics real-time data set enterprise-ready cross-functional target
> and engage consumers uniquely managing multiple access results of data
> science.

I have no idea what you do. Instead, describe the job in words engineers
understand.

> We make a Django application and host it on AWS. Our application
> provides non-technical people with some functionality they couldn't
> otherwise produce themselves. And we make money doing it.

## Don't List Perks ##

It makes you sound materialistic and shallow. Instead list what makes your
company stand out from all the other San Francisco big-data startups. If the
only thing that makes you different is your air hockey table and espresso
machines, you're doing it wrong.

## Don't "Revolutionize" an Industry ##

Change happens slowly; claiming you are revolutionizing the urinal splash guard
industry isn't impressing anyone.

## Copy-edit the Description ##

I can't count on all my fingers and toes the amount of poorly written job
descriptions I've encountered. Nothing makes you look less professional than
grammar and spelling errors on a job description.

## Categorize the Job Title ##

Labeling your job title "Software Engineer" today is useless. Classify what
level of software needs engineering (drivers? firmware? web apps?); they are
*very* different and require *very* different skills. "Full-Stack" doesn't
count. That's not specializing in anything, so you won't get a candidate good
at anything.
